# Onthos

Clean up the muck on your Joomla! site

## ⚠️ WARNING! DANGER!

This component is very powerful, but destructive by definition. It will **REMOVE** software and data from your site. In some edge cases it may remove _too much_, breaking your site in the process. 

You **MUST** take a backup before using this component, and keep that backup separately from your site, e.g. on your local computer. You can use our free of charge Akeeba Backup Core to take backups of your site.

We take no responsibility for broken sites. You have been warned.

## What's in a name

Onthos is pronounced ON-thoss. The "th" sound is the same as in "theory". The stress is on the first syllable.

This is an Ancient Greek word (ὄνθος) which means animal dung, muck.

According to the legend, one of Hercules' feats was cleaning the dung from the stables of Augeas. The stables of Augueas were populated by immortal cattle which produced copious amounts of dung and had never been cleaned.

This component aims to clean the muck off Joomla! sites which have never been cleaned before, a Herculean task by any means.

# Onthos

Clean up the muck on your Joomla! site

## What does it do?

Onthos is an advanced, very powerful extensions manager for Joomla!. It is designed to help power users perform deep cleanup of leftover extensions in ways that previously required database surgery and/or writing custom Console plugins to achieve. 

Onthos not only lists installed extensions, it also detects common problems with them and proposes solutions – some of them can be destructive, so be careful!

Onthos will let you do things Joomla! won't let you, including forced removal of extensions with missing manifest XML files, and extensions' leftover database records.

Onthos is strictly limited to Super Users with a hardcoded check, regardless of the Permissions you may set up in its Options page. This is not a bug, it's a deliberate design choice.

### ⚠️ With great power comes great responsibility

Unlike Joomla's “Extensions: Manage” page, there are no guardrails or protections. It will let you take catastrophic actions. Ignore this warning at your peril.

**Always take a backup before using this software**. Keep your backup safely _outside_ of your site, e.g. on your local computer. Always make sure you know how to restore your site from a backup even if you cannot access your site; try it out _before you need it for real_. You can use our free of charge Akeeba Backup Core for that.

## What's in a name

Onthos is pronounced ON-thoss. The "th" sound is the same as in "theory". The stress is on the first syllable.

This is an Ancient Greek word (ὄνθος) which means animal dung, muck.

According to the legend, one of Hercules' feats was cleaning the dung from the stables of Augeas. The stables of Augueas were populated by immortal cattle which produced copious amounts of dung and had never been cleaned.

This component aims to clean the muck off Joomla! sites which have never been cleaned before, a Herculean task by any means.

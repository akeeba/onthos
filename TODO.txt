How to go about fixing problems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each issue needs to provide a view template name with information on fixing the issue.
public function getDetailsTemplate(): string // e.g. 'issues/myissue', default 'commontemplates/nofixavailable'
We pass the $issue and $extension to the view template

For issue-specific fixes, we need a handler called by ItemController::fix()
public function fix(string $fixAction = 'default'): void
index.php?view=com_onthos&task=item.fix&id=123&action=default

Voodoo Zone
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unprotect

    Marks an extension unprotected (third party extension).

Protect

    Marks an extension protected (core extension).

Unlock

    Marks an extension unlocked (can be enabled, disabled, updated, and uninstalled)

Lock

    Marks an extension locked (cannot be enabled, disabled, updated, and uninstalled)

Smart Uninstall

    Marks an extension unprotected and unlocked, then calls Joomla's extensions uninstaller.

No-Script Uninstall

    Removes the installation script and any references to it in the XML manifest, then calls Joomla's extensions uninstaller.

Forced Uninstall

    Removes the update sites and TUF metadata, all detected tables (ignoring column relations), files, and directories, then removes the `#__extensions` record. DANGEROUS! MUST BE THE LAST RESORT.

Record Remover

    Removes the `#__extensions` record. Only available when NONE of the extension's files and directories is present, including the manifest, script, language, and media files. This is meant to remove leftover records.

Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✔️ WrongParent [fa fa-mitten] error

    The extension is claimed by a package, but the extension claims to be owned by a different package.

✔️ Leftover [fa-ghost] critical

    NONE of the files and directories are present.

✔️ PartiallyInstalled [fa-file-circle-question] error

    There are missing files or directories, but at least ONE of them is present.

✔️ NoScript [fa-scroll] info

    The script file is missing

NoXMLManifest [fa-file-code] critical

    The XML manifest is missing

MissingTables [fa-database] critical

    Only if the extension defines tables. One or more tables are missing.

NoUpdateSite [fa-arrows-rotate] critical

    The manifest has an update site, but it is currently missing in the database.

WrongUpdateSite [fa-arrow-rotate-left] notice

    The manifest has an update site, but the extension has a different update site in the database.

DisabledUpdateSite [fa-ban] error

    The manifest has an update site, it exists in the database, but it's currently disabled.

SchemaOutOfDate [fa-table-list] warning

    Only if the extension defines tables. Joomla! reports one or more database schema issues for the extension.

How to go about fixing problems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each issue needs to provide a view template name with information on fixing the issue.
public function getDetailsTemplate(): string // e.g. 'issues/myissue', default 'commontemplates/nofixavailable'
We pass the $issue and $extension to the view template
>> Why a view template and not a lang string? Because some issues may have a more nuanced approach based on additional signals. For example, orphaned extensions with the wrong package ID have a different solution than orphaned extensions with no package ID.

For issue-specific fixes, we need a handler called by ItemController::fix()
public function fix(string $fixAction = 'default'): void
index.php?view=com_onthos&task=item.fix&id=123&action=default

Voodoo Zone

Unprotect

    Marks an extension unprotected (third party extension).

Protect

    Marks an extension protected (core extension).

Unlock

    Marks an extension unlocked (can be enabled, disabled, updated, and uninstalled)

Lock

    Marks an extension locked (cannot be enabled, disabled, updated, and uninstalled)

Smart Uninstall

    Marks an extension unprotected and unlocked, then calls Joomla's extensions uninstaller.

No-Script Uninstall

    Removes the installation script and any references to it in the XML manifest, then calls Joomla's extensions uninstaller.

Forced Uninstall

    Removes the update sites and TUF metadata, all detected tables (ignoring column relations), files, and directories, then removes the `#__extensions` record. DANGEROUS! MUST BE THE LAST RESORT.

Record Remover

    Removes the `#__extensions` record. Only available when NONE of the extension's files and directories is present, including the manifest, script, language, and media files. This is meant to remove leftover records.

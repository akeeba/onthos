Danger Zone (ItemsController)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✔️ Uninstall

    Marks an extension unprotected and unlocked, then calls Joomla's extensions uninstaller.

✔️ No-Script Uninstall

    Removes the installation script, then calls Joomla's extensions uninstaller.

✔️ Forced Uninstall

    Removes the update sites and TUF metadata, all detected tables (ignoring column relations), files, and directories, then removes the `#__extensions` record. DANGEROUS! MUST BE THE LAST RESORT.

Remove Record

    Removes the `#__extensions` record. Only available when NONE of the extension's files and directories is present, including the manifest, script, language, and media files. This is meant to remove leftover records.

COM_ONTHOS_MAIN_EMPTYSTATE_TITLE="No Extensions"
COM_ONTHOS_MAIN_EMPTYSTATE_CONTENT="Your site is broken beyond repair. It reports no installed extensions. <strong>How do you even see this message&#8253;</strong> Joomla! should not be functional at all!"

COM_ONTHOS_MAIN_TABLE_CAPTION="Table of extensions"
COM_ONTHOS_MAIN_FIELD_TYPE="Type"
COM_ONTHOS_MAIN_FIELD_NAME="Name"

COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_TOP_HEADER="Extension Identity"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_HEAD_BASIC="Basic information"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_HEAD_MANDATORY="Mandatory Elements"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_HEAD_OPTIONAL="Optional Elements"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_HEAD_DATABASE="Database Tables"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_HEAD_DATABASE_TOOLTIP="Some extensions create their own tables in your site's database to store their information. If the XML Manifest declares any SQL files which create database tables, this tables are listed below."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_TYPE="Extension Type"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_ELEMENT="Element"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_FOLDER="Folder"

COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_LOCKED="Lock State"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_XML_MANIFEST="XML Manifest"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_XML_MANIFEST_TOOLTIP="The XML Manifest (a.k.a. installation XML) tells Joomla! what the extension name is, which files and database tables it contains etc. This file must be present for Joomla! to be able to uninstall any non-trivial extension without leaving useless garbage behind."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_SCRIPT="Installation Script"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_SCRIPT_TOOLTIP="The installation script is an <em>optional</em> PHP file which allows extension developers to run custom before and after the installation, update, and uninstallation of an extension. It is usually used to enforce PHP and Joomla! version checks, as well as integrating with Joomla! features which require an one-time setup on installation such as Smart Search, Tags, Guided Tours, etc. An outdated installation script may also prevent an extension from uninstall at all after upgrading Joomla! due to incompatibilities with your current Joomla! version."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_DIRECTORIES="Directories"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_DIRECTORIES_TOOLTIP_NO_XML="These are all possible directories where this extension may be storing its files. Normally, this information is contained in the XML Manifest file, but because it's missing Onthos is using Joomla's default conventions for where directories may be. If at least one directory is present the extension is considered installed. If none of them are present, the extension is considered broken. This is the same behaviour as Joomla! itself."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_DIRECTORIES_TOOLTIP="These are all directories where this extension is storing its files, as per its XML Manifest. If any of these directories are missing, the extension may not be working correctly."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_FILES="Files"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_FILES_TOOLTIP="These are all individual files this extension is using, as per its XML Manifest. If any of these files are missing, the extension may not be working correctly."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_FILES_TOOLTIP_NO_XML="These are all possible files this extension may be using. Normally, this information is contained in the XML Manifest file, but because it's missing Onthos is using Joomla's default conventions, including some backwards compatibility fallbacks which are not used in most modern extensions. Usually, these files may be missing without causing a problem with the extension, as long as all of the extension's directories are present."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_LANGFILES="Language Files"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_LANGFILES_TOOLTIP="Language files provide the translated text for each extension. Not all extensions use language files. For the extensions which do use language files, if all of them are missing (or none is found) then you will see &ldquo;broken text&rdquo; both in the extension and Joomla! itself."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_MEDIADIRS="Media Directories"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_SUBHEAD_MEDIADIRS_TOOLTIP="These are the directories where the extension stores media files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc), and/or user-generated files. Not all extensions use a media directory. Please note that templates display two directories: a legacy one, and one under media/templates used with modern templates since Joomla! 4.2."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_NOT_APPLICABLE="N/A"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_APP_UNKNOWN="Unknown"

COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_INSTALLED_TOOLTIP="The extension appears to be (at least partially) installed."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_DISCOVERED="Discovered"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_DISCOVERED_TOOLTIP="Joomla! has discovered the files of the extension, but the extension is not installed yet. You will have to go to System, Install, Discover to install it"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_BROKEN="Broken"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_BROKEN_TOOLTIP="The extension appears installed in the database, but one or more ot the critical files for its operation are missing. This strongly suggest the extension is non-functional, or a junk database entry from something uninstalled in the past."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_CORE="Core Joomla!"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_CORE_TOOLTIP="This extension is shipped with Joomla! itself."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_LINKED="Linked To Package"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_LINKED_TOOLTIP="This extension belongs to a package. Do not try to uninstall it directly; uninstall the package it belongs to instead."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_TOPLEVEL="Top-level Extension"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_TOPLEVEL_TOOLTIP="The extension does not belong to a package, but it has a known update site. This makes it a top-level extension which will not cause any misleading notices when updating Joomla! to a new version."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_ORPHANED="Orphaned Extension"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_ORPHANED_TOOLTIP="This is a third-party extension which neither belongs to a package, nor does it have its own update site. It will very likely cause misleading notices when updating Joomla! to a new version."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_LOCKED="Locked"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_LOCKED_TOOLTIP="Locked extensions cannot be enabled, disabled, uninstalled, or updated through Joomla's interface. This should generally only be the case for extensions included with Joomla! itself."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_UNLOCKED="Unlocked"
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_UNLOCKED_TOOLTIP="Unlocked extensions can be enabled, disabled, uninstalled, and updated through Joomla's interface. This is generally the default lock state for all third party extensions."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_ID_LBL_NA_IS_OK="Elements marked with &ldquo;N/A&rdquo; are not a problem. They are missing, but are optional for this extension type."

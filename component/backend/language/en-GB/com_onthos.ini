COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_COREFORCEDISABLED="This is a core Joomla! extension which is both Disabled and Locked. As a result, you cannot re-enable it from the “Extensions: Manage” page. This always indicates that someone or something has messed up the <code>#__extensions</code> table."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_MISSINGCHILDREN="This Package extension indicates it installs a certain number of extensions, but one or more of them are missing. This issue can only be resolved by reinstalling the package yourself."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_MISSINGLANGUAGE="The extension's XML manifest indicates it installs a certain number of language INI files, but one or more of them are missing. This issue can only be resolved by reinstalling the extension (note that you may have to install a different Package extension)."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_NONCORELOCKED="This third-party developer extension is locked, meaning it cannot be uninstalled. This is highly unusual, and most likely a mistake."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_NONCOREPROTECTED="This third party extension is Protected, preventing it from being disabled or enabled. This is usually reserved for core extensions which must always be enabled, e.g. the user manager (<code>com_users</code>)."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_ORPHANED="This third-party extension does not have an update site and is either not owned by a package, or it claims to be owned by a non-existent package. These extensions will always appear as “Incompatible” whenever you try to update Joomla! to a new version."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_WRONGPARENT="A package claims to have installed this third-party extension, but the database does not have that information. These extensions will always appear as “Incompatible” whenever you try to update Joomla! to a new version."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_LEFTOVER="This extension exists in the database, but its files are no longer present on your site. This strongly indicates a leftover (junk) database entry from an extension removed without using Joomla's extensions manager."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_PARTIALLYINSTALLED="One or more of the files and/or directories of the extension, as declared in its XML manifest, are missing."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_NOSCRIPT="The extension's XML manifest declares an installation script, but the script file is no longer present on your site. This could cause fairly minor problems when uninstalling the extension, e.g. leaving leftover database entries or installed extensions."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_NOXMLMANIFEST="The extension's XML manifest file is missing. Joomla! cannot uninstall this extension cleanly."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_MISSINGTABLES="Some of the tables which are supposed to be created by the extension are not present in your database. The extension is very likely broken."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_SCHEMAOUTOFDATE="Joomla reports that there are some errors in your extension's database tables."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_WRONGUPDATESITE="The update site in Joomla's database does not match the update site advertised in the extension's XML Manifest. You might not be receiving updates for this extension, or only seeing updates to its older versions. This can also cause this extension to appear as “incompatible” when updating Joomla!."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION_DISABLEDUPDATESITE="There are update sites for this extension, but they are disabled. You are not receiving updates for this extension. This can also cause this extension to appear as “incompatible” when updating Joomla!."

COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_FIX_NOFIXAVAILABLE="Onthos cannot make a recommendation for addressing this issue."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_FIX_REINSTALL_CORE="Updating Joomla! or, if no update is available, refreshing its files may help address this issue. Please note that some core extensions appear to have this issue even though they are not affected due to a Joomla! bug: most core extensions' XML manifests are outdated, listing the wrong contents for each core extension, causing false positives in Onthos."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_FIX_REINSTALL="Reinstalling the extension may help address this issue."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_FIX_UNINSTALL_OPTIONAL="If you no longer need the extension you can of course uninstall it."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_FIX_UNINSTALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGE="If you no longer need the extension you can of course uninstall its package, “%s” (extension #%d)."

COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_FIX_PUBLISH="Enable the extension to address this issue."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_FIX_PUBLISH_UPDATE_SITE="Publish the disabled update sites to address this issue."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_FIX_UPDATE_SCHEMA="Asking Joomla! to automatically fix the database tables of the extension (‘Database Fix’) will very likely address this issue. Do note that for some extensions it may not work, but it might only be a minor issue."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_FIX_UNLOCK="Unlock the extension to address this issue."
COM_ONTHOS_ISSUES_FIX_UNPROTECT="Unprotect the extension to address this issue."

COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_XML_MANIFEST="XML Manifest"
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_XML_MANIFEST_TOOLTIP="The XML Manifest (a.k.a. installation XML) tells Joomla! what the extension name is, which files and database tables it contains etc. This file must be present for Joomla! to be able to uninstall any non-trivial extension without leaving useless garbage behind."
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_SCRIPT="Installation Script"
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_SCRIPT_TOOLTIP="The installation script is an <em>optional</em> PHP file which allows extension developers to run custom before and after the installation, update, and uninstallation of an extension. It is usually used to enforce PHP and Joomla! version checks, as well as integrating with Joomla! features which require an one-time setup on installation such as Smart Search, Tags, Guided Tours, etc. An outdated installation script may also prevent an extension from uninstall at all after upgrading Joomla! due to incompatibilities with your current Joomla! version."
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_DIRECTORIES="Directories"
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_DIRECTORIES_TOOLTIP_NO_XML="These are all possible directories where this extension may be storing its files. Normally, this information is contained in the XML Manifest file, but because it's missing Onthos is using Joomla's default conventions for where directories may be. If at least one directory is present the extension is considered installed. If none of them are present, the extension is considered broken. This is the same behaviour as Joomla! itself."
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_DIRECTORIES_TOOLTIP="These are all directories where this extension is storing its files, as per its XML Manifest. If any of these directories are missing, the extension may not be working correctly."
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_FILES="Files"
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_FILES_TOOLTIP="These are all individual files this extension is using, as per its XML Manifest. If any of these files are missing, the extension may not be working correctly."
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_FILES_TOOLTIP_NO_XML="These are all possible files this extension may be using. Normally, this information is contained in the XML Manifest file, but because it's missing Onthos is using Joomla's default conventions, including some backwards compatibility fallbacks which are not used in most modern extensions. Usually, these files may be missing without causing a problem with the extension, as long as all of the extension's directories are present."
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_LANGFILES="Language Files"
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_LANGFILES_TOOLTIP="Language files provide the translated text for each extension. Not all extensions use language files. For the extensions which do use language files, if all of them are missing (or none is found) then you will see &ldquo;broken text&rdquo; both in the extension and Joomla! itself."
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_MEDIADIRS="Media Directories"
COM_ONTHOS_ITEM_SUBHEAD_MEDIADIRS_TOOLTIP="These are the directories where the extension stores media files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc), and/or user-generated files. Not all extensions use a media directory. Please note that templates display two directories: a legacy one, and one under media/templates used with modern templates since Joomla! 4.2."

[Common]
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_UNRELIABLE_CORE_HEAD="Information for core Joomla! extensions is unreliable."
COM_ONTHOS_COMMON_UNRELIABLE_CORE_BODY="The XML manifests Joomla! includes for its core extensions are <em>outdated and erroneous</em>, listing files and directories which no longer exist. This is a bug in Joomla! itself. As a result of this bug, the information about core extensions –including whether an extension is Broken or not– is unreliable."
